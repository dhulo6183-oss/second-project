# Python Menu-Driven Program 🚀

A simple **menu-driven Python application** that allows users to:
- Generate star patterns
- Analyze a range of numbers (Odd, Even, Sum)
- Exit the program gracefully

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates the use of:
- Conditional statements
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- User input handling
- Menu-based program structure
