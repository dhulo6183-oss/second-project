📖 Project Overview
This project is a menu-driven Python application that allows users to perform multiple operations using a simple command-line interface. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

It demonstrates the use of:

Loops

Conditional statements

User input handling

Basic logic building in Python


⚙️ Features
🔹 1. Pattern Generation
Generates a right-angled star pattern

User defines the number of rows

Useful for understanding nested loops

Example Output:

*
**
***
****


🔹 2. Range Analysis
Accepts a start and end number

Identifies whether each number is Odd or Even

Calculates the sum of all numbers in the given range

Example Output:

Number is Odd 2
Number is Even 1
Sum is: 3

🔹 3. Exit Option
Allows the user to safely terminate the program

Displays a friendly exit message

🧠 Program Flow
Display menu options

Take user input

Execute selected operation

Repeat until user chooses Exit
